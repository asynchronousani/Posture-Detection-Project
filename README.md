# Posture-Detection-Project
-> This is a deep learning project whose objective is to detect a single human posture. 

-> This project is made by using HTML, JavaScript, PoseNet and ml5.js. 

-> PoseNet is a deep learning TensorFlow model that allows you to estimate and track human poses by detecting body parts such as elbows, hips, wrists, knees, and ankles. It uses the joints of these body parts to determine body postures. 

-> ml5.js is an open source, friendly high level interface to TensorFlow. js, a library for handling GPU-accelerated mathematical operations and memory management for machine learning algorithms.
